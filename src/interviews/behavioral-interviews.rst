Behavioral Interviews
=====================

Interviews for technical jobs can broken down into two distinct parts: behavioral and technical. Here, we discuss the behavioral component of interviews. These can be part of a larger interview that includes a technical component, or they may be part of a separate interview. 

Behavioral interviews are intended to gauge a candidate's potential fit as a coworker, in a broad sense. These won't be significantly different from interviews you've likely experienced before. An employer wants to answer questions like:

* Does the candidate communicate well? 
* Is the candidate able to deal with high-pressure situations?
* Is the candidate a self-motivated learner?
* Does the candidate work well in a team environment?
* And so on...

Your objective is to convince the employer that they can answer "yes" to each of these questions. Of course, you will not be asked these specfiic questions; you will be asked questions that are intended to measure the degree to which you fulfill these characteristics. 

The CAR Technique
-----------------

If you look online, you will find lots of articles and approaches to succeeding in behavioral interviews. Most of these are very similar, and we want to explore one such technique in detail, the **CAR Technique**.

CAR stands for Challenge, Action, Result, and it outlines the way in which you should try to respond to each behavioral interview question. 

Read `The C.A.R. Technique: Your Secret Interviewing Weapon <https://thehiredguns.com/car-technique-secret-interviewing-weapon/>`_ to get an overview of this technique.

Read `Context, Action, Result (CAR): answering interview questions and describing experience effectively <http://joshuaspodek.com/context-action-result-car-answering-interview-questions-describing-experience-effectively>`_ to explore specific examples of good responses that use the CAR technique.

Practicing Responding to Behavioral Questions
---------------------------------------------

Now, practice using the CAR model by using it to answer each of the following questions. 

**User the Voice Memo app on your phone to record your response, then listen back to it and evaluate how effective you were.**

* What is one of your main strenths?
* What is one of your weaknesses?
* Describe a time when you had to overcome a challenge.
* Tell me about a time recently when you had to learn something new.
